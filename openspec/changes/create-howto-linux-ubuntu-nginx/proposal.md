## Why

Linux Ubuntu users need a comprehensive guide to set up and use the R data analysis tools in this project, as well as host the generated web files on a local server. Currently, there is no documentation available for Ubuntu users, making it difficult for them to install dependencies, configure their environment, run the R scripts for data analysis, and serve the resulting visualizations on a web server. This how-to guide will bridge the gap and enable Ubuntu users to effectively use these tools.

## What Changes

- Create a comprehensive how-to guide for Linux Ubuntu users
- Document the complete installation process for R and required packages
- Provide step-by-step instructions for running each visualization script
- Include troubleshooting tips for common Ubuntu-specific issues
- Document how to configure the data directory and file paths
- Add nginx installation and configuration for serving static web files
- Document how to host and access the generated HTML visualizations

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `linux-ubuntu-setup`: A complete setup guide covering R installation, RStudio (optional), and all required system dependencies on Ubuntu
- `linux-ubuntu-usage`: Usage instructions for running each R script in the visualizations/R directory
- `linux-ubuntu-data`: Guide for preparing and loading data files on Ubuntu systems
- `linux-ubuntu-nginx-hosting`: Guide for installing nginx and configuring it to serve the generated HTML visualization files

### Modified Capabilities
- (None - this is a new documentation capability)

## Impact

- New documentation files in the project
- No changes to existing code or dependencies
- Benefits Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distribution users
- Enables users to share their visualizations via a local web server
